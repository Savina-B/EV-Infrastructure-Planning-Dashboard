# EV-Infrastructure-Planning-Dashboard

**Overview**

This project showcases an interactive geospatial decision-support dashboard designed to help public-sector stakeholders explore potential locations and demand patterns for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure across a large UK region.

The application integrates spatial data, scenario modelling, and user-defined weightings to support evidence-based infrastructure planning at multiple geographic resolutions.

⚠️ All descriptions, visuals, and code excerpts in this repository have been sanitised and anonymised for confidentiality.

**Key Capabilities**

- Multi-layer interactive mapping
  - Choropleth scoring layers
  - Demand and flow visualisation
  - Optional contextual layers (e.g. capacity, accessibility)
    
- Scenario-based analysis
  - Origin, destination, and en-route charging perspectives
  - Configurable behavioural and travel scenarios

- User-defined weighting framework
  - Slider-based importance controls
  - Composite scoring across multiple socio-economic and transport indicators

- Temporal exploration
  - Forecast year sliders
  - Scenario comparison across time horizons

- Data export
  - Filtered CSV outputs for downstream analysis

**Data (high-level, anonymised)**

- Aggregated transport demand outputs from a regional assignment model

- EV uptake and charging demand forecasts

- Socio-demographic indicators (e.g. housing type, accessibility, deprivation)

- Geospatial boundary datasets at multiple resolutions

All datasets shown are either:

- Aggregated

- Modelled

- Or replaced with representative structures for demonstration

**Technology Stack**

- Python

- Dash / Plotly

- GeoPandas

- PostgreSQL (PostGIS)

- Dash Design Kit

- Pandas / NumPy


**Screenshots**

Screenshots shown are redacted UI samples using anonymised geography and placeholder values to demonstrate interaction patterns and technical capability.
